This example demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in PHP's foreach loop. When iterating through an array with a foreach loop, attempting to modify keys during the iteration can produce unexpected results and errors. The issue stems from foreach maintaining an internal copy of the keys, ignoring any modifications during the iteration. The provided solution offers a workaround.
